---

## When to Use

- Addressing theological questions or doctrinal topics
- Teaching from a biblical text or passage
- Developing a systematic understanding of what Scripture teaches
- Preparing sermons, Bible studies, or theological lessons
- Resolving apparent contradictions in Scripture
- Grounding practical guidance in biblical authority

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| topic_or_text | Yes | The theological topic to explore OR the biblical text to expound |
| context | No | The situation prompting this inquiry (pastoral, academic, personal) |
| audience | No | Who will receive this teaching (scholars, laypeople, seekers) |
| application_focus | No | Specific life situation requiring application |

## Workflow
### Core Principle

Biblical interpretation has one essential purpose: to understand what God has revealed in Scripture—nothing more, nothing less, nothing other. The chief virtue of an interpreter lies in **clear brevity**.

As Calvin wrote: "It is the first business of an interpreter to let his author say what he does say, instead of attributing to him what we think he ought to say."

### Phase 1: Exegesis (What Does the Text Say?)

**Grammatical Analysis:**
- What do the words mean in their original language?
- How does the grammar structure the meaning?
- What is the literary genre (narrative, poetry, epistle, prophecy)?

**Historical Context:**
- What was the author's situation?
- Who was the original audience?
- What circumstances prompted this writing?
- What would the original readers have understood?

**Literary Context:**
- How does this passage fit within its immediate context?
- How does it fit within the book as a whole?
- What argument or narrative is the author building?

**Key Questions:**

### Step 1: What is the one essential meaning of this text?



### Step 2: What did the author intend to communicate?



### Step 3: What would the original audience have understood?



### Phase 2: Dogmatics (How Does It Fit the Whole?)

**Analogy of Faith:**
- Scripture interprets Scripture
- Difficult passages understood in light of clear passages
- The whole Bible forms a unified theological system

**Systematic Integration:**
- How does this teaching relate to other biblical doctrines?
- Where else does Scripture address this topic?
- How does this fit within the redemptive-historical storyline?

**Christocentric Focus:**
- How does this text point to Christ?
- Where does it fit in the unfolding of God's redemptive plan?
- What does it reveal about God's character and purposes?

**Key Questions:**

### Step 1: How does this passage connect to the broader biblical witness?



### Step 2: What systematic doctrine does this inform or support?



### Step 3: How does this fit the unity of Scripture?



### Phase 3: Preaching/Application (What Must We Do?)

**From Doctrine to Life:**
- Sound doctrine always has practical implications
- Theology without application is dead orthodoxy
- Application without theology is dangerous pragmatism

**Application Categories:**
- What does this reveal about God that demands worship?
- What does this reveal about humanity that demands humility?
- What does this command that demands obedience?
- What does this promise that demands faith?
- What does this warn against that demands repentance?

**Key Questions:**

### Step 1: How should this truth change how we think?



### Step 2: How should this truth change how we live?



### Step 3: What response does this text demand?

## Constraints

- Never speculate beyond what Scripture reveals
- Never make the text say what you think it ought to say
- Never divorce doctrine from application
- Acknowledge uncertainty where the text is unclear
- Avoid allegory—seek the author's original intent
- Maintain "clear brevity"—don't obscure truth with complexity
- Let difficult passages be interpreted by clear ones

## Example

**Input:** "What does Scripture teach about suffering? I'm going through a hard time and need biblical grounding."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Systematic Biblical Exposition: The Purpose of Suffering

### The Question
What does Scripture teach about why believers suffer, and how should this truth shape our response to hardship?

### Phase 1: Exegesis

**Key Texts:**
- Romans 5:3-5 (suffering produces character)
- Romans 8:28-29 (all things work together for good)
- James 1:2-4 (trials produce steadfastness)
- 1 Peter 1:6-7 (trials refine faith like gold)
- 2 Corinthians 1:3-7 (suffering equips us to comfort others)
- 2 Corinthians 4:16-18 (light affliction prepares eternal glory)

**Grammatical-Historical Analysis:**

*Romans 5:3-5:* Paul writes to believers facing persecution. The Greek "thlipsis" (tribulation) refers to pressure or affliction. Paul describes a causal chain: tribulation produces (katergazetai - "works out, accomplishes") perseverance, which produces character, which produces hope. This is not automatic but describes God's sanctifying work through suffering.

*James 1:2-4:* James commands "consider it all joy" (not "feel happy"). The testing of faith (dokimion - proving, as metals are tested) produces steadfastness (hupomone - patient endurance). The purpose: "that you may be perfect and complete, lacking nothing."

**One Essential Meaning:**
Suffering in the life of a believer is purposeful, not random. God uses affliction as an instrument of sanctification, conforming believers to Christ's image and producing spiritual maturity.

### Phase 2: Systematic Integration

**Biblical-Theological Context:**
Suffering entered the world through the Fall (Genesis 3), but God sovereignly uses it for redemptive purposes. Christ Himself was "made perfect through suffering" (Hebrews 2:10). Believers are called to share in Christ's sufferings (Philippians 3:10) as they await final glorification.

**Connection to Other Doctrines:**
- **God's Sovereignty:** God ordains or permits all that occurs; nothing is outside His control (Romans 8:28)
- **Sanctification:** Suffering is one of God's primary tools for conforming us to Christ (Romans 8:29)
- **Eschatology:** Present sufferings are "light and momentary" compared to eternal glory (2 Corinthians 4:17)
- **Providence:** God works all things for His glory and our good

**Christocentric Focus:**
Christ is both the model and the goal. He suffered perfectly; we are being conformed to His image through suffering. Our union with Christ means sharing His sufferings now and His glory later.

**Summary Doctrine:**
God sovereignly uses suffering to sanctify believers, produce mature faith, conform them to Christ's image, equip them for ministry to others, and prepare them for eternal glory. Suffering is not meaningless but purposeful in God's redemptive plan.

### Phase 3: Application

**For Worship:**
This truth reveals a God who is:
- Sovereign over all circumstances (nothing escapes His control)
- Wise in His purposes (He wastes nothing)
- Good in His intentions (working for our ultimate good)
- Faithful to His promises (completing the work He began)

This demands trust, even when we cannot see the purpose.

**For Living:**
1. Do not demand an explanation for every trial—trust God's hidden wisdom
2. Look for opportunities to grow—what is God teaching through this?
3. Minister to others from your wounds—your comfort can comfort them
4. Fix your eyes on eternity—"light and momentary" affliction prepares "eternal weight of glory"
5. Persevere—endurance is the path to maturity

**For Your Situation:**
Your suffering is not random, though its specific purpose may be hidden. You are called to:
- Trust that God is at work even when you cannot see it
- Remain faithful in the trial rather than escaping it by sinful means
- Look for what God might be producing in you
- Receive comfort from God and give it to others

### Cautions
- Scripture does not promise we will always understand our suffering in this life
- We should not speculate about hidden divine purposes (Job's friends' error)
- The doctrine of suffering's purpose does not eliminate lament—the Psalms model honest grief
- We cannot always discern which specific purpose God has in a particular trial
